Net::NAT::PMP
-------------

Net::NAT::PMP is a client for the NAT Port Mapping Protocol (NAT-PMP),
which is currently an RFC draft. NAT-PMP is designed so that you can
have rich network applications that can still work even behind your
home router's NAT.

For full documentation, run:
  perldoc lib/Net/NAT/PMP.pm
